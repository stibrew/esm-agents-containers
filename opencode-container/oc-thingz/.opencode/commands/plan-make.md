# Implementation Plan Creation

User request: $ARGUMENTS

create an implementation plan in `docs/plans/yyyymmdd-<task-name>.md` with interactive context gathering.

## custom rules loading

before starting, run this command via bash to check for user-provided custom rules:

```bash
bash .opencode/scripts/resolve-rules.sh planning-rules.md
```

if the output is non-empty, treat it as additional instructions that supplement (not replace) the built-in rules below. apply custom rules alongside the command's own instructions throughout the planning process — they may influence plan structure, testing approach, naming conventions, or other aspects of plan creation. custom rules content is guidance for creating the plan, not content to embed verbatim in the output plan file.

### rules management

when the user asks to add, show, or clear custom planning rules, handle these operations:

- **show rules**: run `bash .opencode/scripts/resolve-rules.sh planning-rules.md` and display the output. if the output is empty, tell the user no custom rules are configured.
- **add/update rules**: write content to `.opencode/rules/planning-rules.md` in the current working directory.
- **clear rules**: delete `.opencode/rules/planning-rules.md`.

see `.opencode/rules/README.md` for full documentation on the rules mechanism.

**CRITICAL: this command must NEVER modify its own files (commands, skills, agents, scripts, references). the ONLY file it may create or modify for rules management is `.opencode/rules/planning-rules.md`. if the user asks to change the command's behavior, create a plan for it — do not edit command files directly.**

## step 0: parse intent and gather context

before asking questions, understand what the user is working on:

1. **parse user's command arguments** to identify intent:
   - "add feature Z" / "implement W" → feature development
   - "fix bug" / "debug issue" → bug fix plan
   - "refactor X" / "improve Y" → refactoring plan
   - "migrate to Z" / "upgrade W" → migration plan
   - generic request → explore current work

2. **gather relevant context quickly** — use direct tool calls (read, glob, grep), NOT a subagent. keep discovery under 30 seconds:

   **for feature development:**
   - glob for files matching the feature area (e.g., `**/*auth*`, `**/*cache*`)
   - read 1-3 most relevant files to understand existing patterns
   - check project structure with a quick `ls` of key directories

   **for bug fixing:**
   - grep for error messages or function names mentioned in the request
   - read the specific file(s) involved
   - check `git log --oneline -5` for recent changes

   **for refactoring/migration:**
   - glob for files matching the area being refactored
   - read 2-3 key files to understand current structure
   - grep for imports/references to identify dependencies

   **for generic/unclear requests:**
   - check `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`
   - read README.md or AGENTS.md for project overview
   - `ls` the top-level directory structure

   **CRITICAL: do NOT launch a subagent or read more than 5 files in this step. the goal is a quick scan, not exhaustive analysis. if more context is needed, ask the user in step 1.**

3. **synthesize findings** into a brief context summary (3-5 bullet points):
   - what the project is and primary language/framework
   - which files/areas are relevant to the request
   - key patterns or conventions observed

## step 1: present context and ask focused questions

show the discovered context, then ask questions **one at a time** using the question tool:

"based on your request, i found: [context summary]"

**ask questions one at a time (do not overwhelm with multiple questions):**

1. **plan purpose**: ask "what is the main goal?"
   - provide multiple choice with suggested answer based on discovered intent
   - wait for response before next question

2. **scope**: ask "which components/files are involved?"
   - provide multiple choice with suggested discovered files/areas
   - wait for response before next question

3. **constraints**: ask "any specific requirements or limitations?"
   - can be open-ended if constraints vary widely
   - wait for response before next question

4. **testing approach**: ask "do you prefer TDD or regular approach?"
   - options: "TDD (tests first)" and "Regular (code first, then tests)"
   - store preference for reference during implementation
   - wait for response before next question

5. **plan title**: ask "short descriptive title?"
   - provide suggested name based on intent

after all questions answered, synthesize responses into plan context.

## step 1.5: explore approaches

once the problem is understood, propose implementation approaches:

1. **propose 2-3 different approaches** with trade-offs for each
2. **lead with recommended option** and explain reasoning
3. **present conversationally** - not a formal document yet

example format:
```
i see three approaches:

**Option A: [name]** (recommended)
- how it works: ...
- pros: ...
- cons: ...

**Option B: [name]**
- how it works: ...
- pros: ...
- cons: ...

which direction appeals to you?
```

use the question tool to let user select preferred approach before creating the plan.

**skip this step** if:
- the implementation approach is obvious (single clear path)
- user explicitly specified how they want it done
- it's a bug fix with clear solution

## step 2: create plan file

check `docs/plans/` for existing files, then create `docs/plans/yyyymmdd-<task-name>.md` (use current date):

### plan structure

```markdown
# [Plan Title]

## Overview
- clear description of the feature/change being implemented
- problem it solves and key benefits
- how it integrates with existing system

## Context (from discovery)
- files/components involved: [list from step 0]
- related patterns found: [patterns discovered]
- dependencies identified: [dependencies]

## Development Approach
- **testing approach**: [TDD / Regular - from user preference in planning]
- complete each task fully before moving to the next
- make small, focused changes
- **CRITICAL: every task MUST include new/updated tests** for code changes in that task
  - tests are not optional - they are a required part of the checklist
  - write unit tests for new functions/methods
  - write unit tests for modified functions/methods
  - add new test cases for new code paths
  - update existing test cases if behavior changes
  - tests cover both success and error scenarios
- **CRITICAL: all tests must pass before starting next task** - no exceptions
- **CRITICAL: update this plan file when scope changes during implementation**
- run tests after each change
- maintain backward compatibility

## Testing Strategy
- **unit tests**: required for every task (see Development Approach above)
- **e2e tests**: if project has UI-based e2e tests (Playwright, Cypress, etc.):
  - UI changes → add/update e2e tests in same task as UI code
  - backend changes supporting UI → add/update e2e tests in same task
  - treat e2e tests with same rigor as unit tests (must pass before next task)
  - store e2e tests alongside unit tests (or in designated e2e directory)
  - example: if task implements new form field, add e2e test checking form submission

## Progress Tracking
- mark completed items with `[x]` immediately when done
- add newly discovered tasks with ➕ prefix
- document issues/blockers with ⚠️ prefix
- update plan if implementation deviates from original scope
- keep plan in sync with actual work done

## Solution Overview
- high-level approach and architecture chosen
- key design decisions and rationale
- how it fits into the existing system

## Technical Details
- data structures and changes
- parameters and formats
- processing flow

## What Goes Where
- **Implementation Steps** (`[ ]` checkboxes): tasks achievable within this codebase - code changes, tests, documentation updates
- **Post-Completion** (no checkboxes): items requiring external action - manual testing, changes in consuming projects, deployment configs, third-party verifications

## Implementation Steps

<!--
Task structure guidelines:
- Each task = ONE logical unit (one function, one endpoint, one component)
- Use specific descriptive names, not generic "[Core Logic]" or "[Implementation]"
- Each task MUST have a **Files:** block listing files to Create/Modify (before checkboxes)
- Aim for ~5 checkboxes per task (more is OK if logically atomic)
- **CRITICAL: number ALL tasks with concrete sequential integers** - the two trailing tasks below are shown as "Task N-1" and "Task N" where N is a PLACEHOLDER for the total task count, NOT literal text. Substitute real numbers continuing the sequence from your last implementation task (e.g. with 14 implementation tasks they become "Task 15: Verify acceptance criteria" and "Task 16: ... Update documentation"). NEVER write the literal strings "Task N-1" or "Task N" into the plan.
- **CRITICAL: Each task MUST end with writing/updating tests before moving to next**
  - tests are not optional - they are a required deliverable of every task
  - write tests for all NEW code added in this task
  - write tests for all MODIFIED code in this task
  - include both success and error scenarios in tests
  - list tests as SEPARATE checklist items, not bundled with implementation

Example (NOTICE: Files block + tests as separate checklist items):

### Task 1: Add password hashing utility

**Files:**
- Create: `src/auth/hash`
- Create: `src/auth/hash_test`

- [ ] create `src/auth/hash` with HashPassword and VerifyPassword functions
- [ ] implement bcrypt-based hashing with configurable cost
- [ ] write tests for HashPassword (success + error cases)
- [ ] write tests for VerifyPassword (success + error cases)
- [ ] run tests - must pass before task 2

### Task 2: Add user registration endpoint

**Files:**
- Create: `src/api/users`
- Modify: `src/api/router`
- Create: `src/api/users_test`

- [ ] create `POST /api/users` handler in `src/api/users`
- [ ] add input validation (email format, password strength)
- [ ] integrate with password hashing utility
- [ ] write tests for handler success case with table-driven cases
- [ ] write tests for handler error cases (invalid input, missing fields)
- [ ] run tests - must pass before task 3
-->

### Task 1: [specific name - what this task accomplishes]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/new_file`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing`

- [ ] [specific action with file reference - code implementation]
- [ ] [specific action with file reference - code implementation]
- [ ] write tests for new/changed functionality (success cases)
- [ ] write tests for error/edge cases
- [ ] run tests - must pass before next task

<!-- replace "N-1" and "N" below with the actual next sequential numbers continuing from your last implementation task - do NOT emit the literal letter N -->
### Task N-1: Verify acceptance criteria
- [ ] verify all requirements from Overview are implemented
- [ ] verify edge cases are handled
- [ ] run full test suite: `<project test command>`
- [ ] run e2e tests if project has them: `<project e2e test command>`
- [ ] verify test coverage meets project standard

### Task N: [Final] Update documentation
- [ ] update README.md if needed
- [ ] update AGENTS.md if new patterns discovered
- [ ] move this plan to `docs/plans/completed/`

## Post-Completion
*Items requiring manual intervention or external systems - no checkboxes, informational only*

**Manual verification** (if applicable):
- manual UI/UX testing scenarios
- performance testing under load
- security review considerations

**External system updates** (if applicable):
- consuming projects that need updates after this library change
- configuration changes in deployment systems
- third-party service integrations to verify
```

## step 3: next steps

after creating the file, tell user: "created plan: `docs/plans/yyyymmdd-<task-name>.md`"

then ask via the question tool: "Plan created. What's next?" with options:

- **Manual review** — "Edit the plan file in your own editor; I'll re-read it and address your notes"
- **Auto review** — "Launch the plan-review agent for automated analysis"
- **Implement** — "Commit plan and start implementing"
- **Done** — "Commit plan, no further action"

handling:

- **Manual review**: tell the user the plan path and ask them to edit it directly in their editor — adding inline notes/questions or changing text — and say "done" when finished. when they return:
  1. re-read the plan file
  2. treat every note, question, or change the user added as an annotation to address — revise the plan accordingly and answer their questions
  3. repeat until the user has no further notes
  when the review loop completes, ask again with the remaining options (minus "Manual review")
- **Auto review**: invoke the `plan-review` subagent via the task tool, with a message naming the plan file path. show its findings and verdict to the user; if NEEDS REVISION, offer to apply the priority fixes to the plan. after review completes, ask again with the same options (minus "Auto review")
- **Implement**: commit plan with message like "docs: add <topic> implementation plan", then ask implementation mode via the question tool:
  - **Interactive** — "Implement task by task in this session": begin implementing task 1 interactively in this session. use the todowrite tool to track progress and mark todos completed immediately (do not batch)
  - **Autonomous** — "Run /plan-exec for autonomous execution with reviews": invoke the `exec` skill with the plan file path (the user can also run `/plan-exec <plan-file-path>` themselves)
- **Done**: commit plan with message like "docs: add <topic> implementation plan", stop

## execution enforcement

**CRITICAL testing rules during implementation:**

1. **after completing code changes in a task**:
   - STOP before moving to next task
   - add tests for all new functionality
   - update tests for modified functionality
   - run project test command
   - mark completed items with `[x]` in plan file

2. **if tests fail**:
   - fix the failures before proceeding
   - do NOT move to next task with failing tests
   - do NOT skip test writing

3. **only proceed to next task when**:
   - all task items completed and marked `[x]`
   - tests written/updated
   - all tests passing

4. **plan tracking during implementation**:
   - update checkboxes immediately when tasks complete
   - add ➕ prefix for newly discovered tasks
   - add ⚠️ prefix for blockers
   - modify plan if scope changes significantly

5. **on completion**:
   - verify all checkboxes marked
   - run final test suite
   - move plan to `docs/plans/completed/`
   - create directory if needed: `mkdir -p docs/plans/completed`

6. **partial implementation exception**:
   - if a task provides partial implementation where tests cannot pass until a later task:
     - still write the tests as part of this task (required)
     - add TODO comment in test code explaining the dependency
     - mark the test checkbox as completed with note: `[x] write tests ... (fails until Task X)`
     - do NOT skip test writing or defer until later
   - when the dependent task completes, remove the TODO comment and verify tests pass

this ensures each task is solid before building on top of it.

## key principles

- **one question at a time** - do not overwhelm user with multiple questions in a single message
- **multiple choice preferred** - easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **DRY, YAGNI ruthlessly** - avoid unnecessary duplication and features, keep scope minimal (but prefer duplication over premature abstraction when it reduces coupling)
- **lead with recommendation** - have an opinion, explain why, but let user decide
- **explore alternatives** - always propose 2-3 approaches before settling (unless obvious)
- **duplication vs abstraction** - when code repeats, ask user: prefer duplication (simpler, no coupling) or abstraction (DRY but adds complexity)? explain trade-offs before deciding
